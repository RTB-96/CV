          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p class="design & development">
            I started learning web development because i love the creativity and skill that is involved when it comes to coding and desgning a website.
            I am also interested in learning new coding and proagramming languages like MQL5 that is a specialized C++ based proagramming language,
            of course i can't leave Python out since its a high-level proagramming language and quite challenging to master, but i love challenges,
            so when i get the chance i will give it a go.

          <img class="studio-mixer" src="images/studio-mixer.png" alt="Studio mixer image">
          <p class="other-skills-paragraph">
            First of all, i love music, i find music inspiring when it comes to studying, working or relaxing.
            What i most love about music, is creating my own and that’s why i started learning music production on my own using FL Studio DAW (Digital Audio Workstation),
            studying on my own to learn about music production, helped me develop my own workflow and in my own way i am able to incorporate and adapt this work flow
            to different situations which allows me to be adaptable in any work environment.
            And that's a skill i am pretty confident in, being adaptable in any situation.
